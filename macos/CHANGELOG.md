# Changelog: Dayhand for macOS

Versions before 0.2.0 are described in the commit history (`git log -- macos`). The app has no
signed release yet; `scripts/build-app.sh` writes the version (`DAYHAND_VERSION`, by default the
latest one below).

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-24)

### Added

- **Eight languages**: English (the source), Polish, German, Spanish, French, Brazilian Portuguese,
  Japanese and Simplified Chinese, with each language's plural forms, in every window, the menu bar,
  the reminders and morning summary, the update window and Settings → Updates.
- Settings → General → **Language**: the Mac's languages (the default) or one of the eight. Dayhand's
  windows change at once and the planned notifications are made again in the new language; the menus
  that come with macOS follow after **Restart Dayhand**. `DAYHAND_LANG=<code>` starts the app in a
  language without changing Settings.
- Days and times follow the Mac's region (14:00 or 2:00 PM, "Fri 23 Oct" or "Fri, Oct 23").

### Changed

- The texts live in the string catalog `Localizable.xcstrings`; `scripts/compile-strings.sh` compiles
  it into the `.lproj` folders the package ships (SwiftPM does not compile string catalogs), and
  `Info.plist` lists the eight languages (`CFBundleLocalizations`).
- Date phrases in quick add and the date field stay English in every language ("fri 2pm").
